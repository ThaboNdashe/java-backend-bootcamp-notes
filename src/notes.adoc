side note -> rebase best practice

Pull Request Flow

1. fork the repo
2. clone the repo
3. create a new branch
4. make your changes
5. push the changes
7. create a pull request
8. review and discuss
9. merge or decline
10. update and delete the branch

==== Serverside Rendering(SSR)

Most rendering in modern ui's  rendering is done by the frontend

cons -> SEO

pros -> ssr tries to avoid the first render and in some cases allows  client to do some rendering(javascript).
